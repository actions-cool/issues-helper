## 🍭 Get started quickly

Here is a very simple and commonly used example. The corresponding scenario is: when an issue adds the `help wanted` tag, the system will automatically comment.

```yml
name: Issue Reply

on:
  issues:
    types: [labeled]

jobs:
  reply-helper:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: help wanted
        if: github.event.label.name == 'help wanted'
        uses: actions-cool/issues-helper@v2.4.0
        with:
          actions: 'create-comment'
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          issue-number: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
          body: |
            Hello @${{ github.event.issue.user.login }}. We totally like your proposal/feedback, welcome PR。

            你好 @${{ github.event.issue.user.login }}，我们完全同意你的提议/反馈，欢迎PR。
