jobs:
  check-inactive:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: check-inactive
        uses: actions-cool/issues-helper@v3
        with:

- `issue-state`: The default is `all`. Optional value `open` `closed`, when these 2 items are not, both are `all`
- `issue-assignee`: Multiplayer is not supported. If you do not enter or enter *, all will be searched. Entering `none` will query issues for which the specified person is not added
- `inactive-day`: When entering, it will filter the issue update time earlier than the current time minus the number of inactive days. If not entered, all
- `inactive-label`: The default is `inactive`, others can be customized. When the project does not contain the label, it will be created automatically
- `exclude-labels`: When set to include `$exclude-empty`, no label issue can be excluded

## `check-issue`

Check whether the issue meets the conditions according to the passed parameters and `issue-number`, and return a boolean value.

The effect of the following example is: when an issue is newly opened, verify whether the current issue designator contains `x1` or `x2`.

If one designated person is satisfied, the verification will pass, and at the same time, verify whether the title meets the conditions.
